The software that provides the _New Package Tracker_ is located at: https://tracker.bioconductor.org .  This is where people submit new packages for inclusion in Bioconductor, and we review them.  Once someone registers for the site, Dan can make you a privileged user who is able to review packages.

The tracker is a python web application based on [Roundup](http://roundup.sourceforge.net/). Its source is in [SourceForge](http://hg.code.sf.net/u/dtenenba/roundup-bioc) (as a Mercurial repository) and [in GitHub](https://github.com/dtenenba/bioc_submit). 

For information on the package review process, see [[Reviewing New Packages]].
